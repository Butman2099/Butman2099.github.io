journal = {Chinese Physics Letters},
abstract = {The concept of natural connectivity is reported as a robustness measure of complex networks. The natural connectivity has a clear physical meaning and a simple mathematical formulation. It is shown that the natural connectivity can be derived mathematically from the graph spectrum as an average eigenvalue and that it changes strictly monotonically with the addition or deletion of edges. By comparing the natural connectivity with other typical robustness measures within a scenario of edge elimination, it is demonstrated that the natural connectivity has an acute discrimination which agrees with our intuition.}

journal = {Europhysics Letters},
abstract = {The existence of a scaling between the principal  eigenvector and the subgraph centrality of a complex network indicates that  the network has “good expansion” (GE) properties. GE is the important but  counterintuitive property of being both sparsely populated and highly  connected. We have detected GE properties in half of the 16 real-world  networks studied, which include communication, information and biological  networks. Most of social networks studied do not show GE properties as a  consequence of the existence of communities with low number of  inter-community links. However, the majority of food webs represent  ecosystems that are not composed of separate communities with low  interconnections among them and possess GE properties.}
